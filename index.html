      <section>
      <p>
         <a href="https://www.meetup.com/angularkc/">AngularKC</a> is a community of web-developers who focus and have interest in the Angular framework in Kansas City.
      </p>
      <p>
         We expect all participants to be kind, considerate, and respectful within our community. 
         This code of conduct applies to participants of all ages, all AngularKC events and spaces, online and off, public and private.

            Professionalism
         </h2>
         <p>
            AngularKC is a professional community. We are a diverse group with members of different gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, and with varying experience levels in web-development, Angular, and software development. 
         </p>
         <p>
            We expect communication through any of AngularKC's channels (Slack, Twitter, Meetup, GitHub, etc.) to be constructive and professional.
            We expect all community members to treat each other with respect and professionalism.

            Harassment
         </h2>
         <p class="font-medium">
            We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free community.  We will not tolerate harassment in any form.
         </p>
         <p>Harassment includes:
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
               <li>
                  Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, physical appearance, body size, mental illness, and/or disability</li>
               <li>Threats of violence</li>
               <li>Use of sexual language or imagery at any time</li>
               <li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
               <li>Sustained disruption of talks or events</li>
               <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
               <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
               <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
               <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices</li>
               <li>Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>
            We expect all community members to be respectful of others, their time, and resources. 
            Being a participant in this community does not guarantee or entitle you to specific help, time, or resources from the leadership team or other members.
         </p>

      <section>
         <h2 class="text-2xl mb-1">Reporting</h2>
         <p>
            If you feel unsafe or unwelcome, or notice that someone else is being harassed, please report it as soon as possible. 
            You can make a report by speaking with one of the organizers of the event you are attending, or by contacting a member of AngularKC leadership team via Slack during the event or afterwards.
         </p>
         <p>
            We expect our partner groups and event co-hosts to be alert and take appropriate action to intervene in preventing or stopping harassment and unacceptable behavior. 
         </p>
         <p>
            While this code of conduct applies to AngularKC events and spaces, if you are being harassed by a community member outside our events, we still want to know about it. 
            We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by our community members seriously. 
            This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. 
            AngularKC reserves the right to refuse an individual's attendance to our events or spaces based on the individual's previous behavior at our events, at non-AngularKC events and spaces, and behavior towards people who are not a part of AngularKC.
         </p>
         <p>
            We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. 
            At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom weâ€™ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of community members or the general public. 
            We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
         </p>

      <section>
         <h2 class="text-2xl mb-1">Consequences</h2>
         <p>
            Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. 
            If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the community a welcoming environment for all participants. 
            This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund (for paid events).
